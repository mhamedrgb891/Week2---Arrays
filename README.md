# Week 2 – Arrays and Memory Basics 

 Part of **CS50x 2025 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University**

##  Overview
This week focused on arrays and how data is stored and accessed in memory. We explored how to work with sequences of data and simple searching and sorting algorithms.

##  Topics Covered
- Arrays in C
- ASCII values and characters
- Command-line arguments
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Sorting (Selection, Bubble)

##  Projects
- ✅ Readability
- ✅ Caesar Cipher
- ✅ Substitution Cipher

##  Key Takeaways
- Learned how to manipulate strings using ASCII and arrays.
- Practiced implementing encryption and decryption algorithms.
- Understood how to pass and handle command-line arguments in C.

##  Challenges
Handling string encryption required careful index manipulation. Understanding how C treats strings (as arrays of chars) made a big difference.

## ▶How to Run
```bash
gcc file.c -o output
./output
