# Week 2 – Arrays and Memory Basics 🧮

🎓 Part of **CS50x 2024 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University**

## 📘 Overview
This week focused on arrays and how data is stored and accessed in memory. We explored how to work with sequences of data and simple searching and sorting algorithms.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Arrays in C
- ASCII values and characters
- Command-line arguments
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Sorting (Selection, Bubble)

## 💻 Projects
- ✅ Readability
- ✅ Caesar Cipher
- ✅ Substitution Cipher

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- Learned how to manipulate strings using ASCII and arrays.
- Practiced implementing encryption and decryption algorithms.
- Understood how to pass and handle command-line arguments in C.

## 🧠 Challenges
Handling string encryption required careful index manipulation. Understanding how C treats strings (as arrays of chars) made a big difference.

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
gcc file.c -o output
./output
